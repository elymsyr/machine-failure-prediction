# Machine Failure Prediction

This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict machine failure based on various features. The project is divided into several parts, including data visualization, model selection, model training, and creating a Tkinter-based application for real-time predictions.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Visualization and Feature Selection**: Analyzes the dataset to visualize relationships and select the most relevant features.
2. **Model Selection with GridSearchCV**: Determines the best model and hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
3. **Model Training**: Trains a Gradient Boosting model with the selected features and parameters.
4. **Tkinter Application**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time feature adjustments and predictions.
